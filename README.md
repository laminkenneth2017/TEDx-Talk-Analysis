# Analyzing TEDx Talks – What Makes a Talk Popular?
## Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze TEDx talks to determine the factors that make a talk popular. Using Power BI for data visualization, the project explores relationships between ratings, views, comments, talk duration, publication dates, and speaker influence to provide insights for future speakers looking to maximize engagement.
## 1. Introduction
TEDx Talks have become a global platform for sharing ideas that inspire, educate, and entertain audiences worldwide. Understanding what makes a TEDx talk successful can provide valuable insights for speakers looking to maximize their engagement. This report analyzes TEDx talks based on ratings, views, comments, speaker influence, and talk duration to determine the characteristics of a popular TEDx talk.
## 2. Data Collection & Preparation
The dataset was obtained from TEDx talk records and prepared for analysis using Power BI. The data was cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy, handling missing values and eliminating inconsistencies in categories such as speaker names, event types, and rating counts.
## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 4. Key Findings & Insights
The best TEDx talks are Inspiring, Persuasive, Informative, or Fascinating. Talks given on weekdays (especially Tuesday-Thursday) receive more engagement. March, April, May, and June are the best months for publishing a TEDx talk. TEDGlobal events attract more views than other TEDx conferences. Talks with an optimal duration of 18 minutes perform better than longer ones.

### 5. Recommendations
- Speakers should focus on engaging themes that are inspiring, informative, and persuasive.
- Talks should be scheduled for publication on weekdays, preferably in the first half of the year.
- Speakers should keep their talk duration around 18 minutes to maintain audience engagement.
- New speakers should study top-rated speakers like Ken Robinson and Simon Sinek to understand what makes their delivery compelling.

### 6. Conclusion
   
By analyzing TEDx talks, this study provides actionable insights into what makes a talk successful. These findings can help speakers optimize their content, delivery, and scheduling to maximize their audience reach and engagement. Future research could explore how specific topics influence talk popularity or delve into sentiment analysis of audience comments for deeper insights.
